# Digital-Garden Webring
> A webring for digital gardens. Inspired by @maxboeck

Based on Max BÃ¶ck's [webring boilerplate](https://github.com/maxboeck/webring)

## Usage
1. First, [add yourself](https://github.com/binyamin/dg-webring/issues/new/choose) to the list.
2. Link to `https://dg-webring.netlify.app/prev`, `/next`, and `/random` on your site.
    - *Note*: The links must be on a page which is a subpage of your digital garden.\
      (Eg. if the url is `/garden`; `/webring` is not a good place, while `/garden` and `/garden/webring` are.)
3. Style it however you like!
